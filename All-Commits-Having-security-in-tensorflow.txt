    Refactor and speed up pylint code by ~15%.
    
    Speed up from 177s to 152s.
    
    Remove loop that was checking each error individually against allowlist regexps one by one. This is slow and also results in the same line being reported multiple times (e.g., for a total of 254 pylint reports, there are 1356 matches printed).
    
    Furthermore, loop seems to have matched real errors against the approved list (because it takes regexps as words, not as lines! -- see below), thus allowing linting errors to pass through. Fixing them in this change too.
    
    ```
    Found an allowlisted error:
      tensorflow/security/fuzzing/raggedCountSparseOutput_fuzz.py:36: [C0330(bad-continuation), ] Wrong hanging indentation (remove 6 spaces).
      via space
          ^^^^^ (this is a word in a allowlist line, taken as a regexp to match)
    ```
    
    Display proper statistics about the errors at the end of the step.
    
    Part of the work for #46046, #43040. Unblocks #46075

    Completely rewrite `GetMatchingPaths`.
    
    The current parallel implementation is too complex (lambda inside lambda, two levels of parallelism) and has a read outside of bounds issue.
    
    The new implementation cleans up artifacts from the previous implementations that were left in the code as it evolves. We add multiple helper functions, and document invariants and preconditions as well as every major step. This way, we fix the security issue and a potential new one which was not caught before

    Refactor DecodeImageOp for the purpose of removing redundant data parsing and format checks from python wrapper and having them take place only in kernels. Remove security concerns. This change:
    
    - Creates new op kernel (`DecodeImageV2Op`) that can decode all four image formats (jpg, png, gif, bmp). `DecodeImage` is the op name. `DecodeBmpOp` is moved into `DecodeImageV2Op`. (Now we have `gen_image_ops.decode_image` as opposed to previous `decode_image` which was a pure python implementation.)
    - Updates GIF decoder to take in `expand_animation` flag for decoding just one frame.
    - Removes data parsing and format checking logic from python layer entirely.
    - Updates magic bytes for detecting image formats.
    - Replicates portions of `convert_image_dtype` functionality in kernel (for optionally converting uint8/uint16 -> float32).

    Remove 2**40 size limit on TensorShape and harden to overflow
    
    The limit was preventing valid uses of TensorShape as the dense shape of very
    large sparse tensors.  There's no security advantage to the limit, since a
    memory allocation of 2**40 bytes is already far beyond a reasonable machine
    size.  The new limit is std::numeric_limits<int64>::max().
    
    In addition, the previous TensorShape code did not check for overflow when
    multiplying, which meant an operation as simple as
    
        tf.gather(tf.zeros([2**5, 2**60 + 1]), 7).eval()
    
    would appear as valid during TensorShape construction and then crash.
    A new MultiplyWithoutOverflow function does the correct overflow checking.
    
    Fixes #8494.

    Switch debug_grpc_testlib to bind on localhost
    
    Since there are no multi-machine tests, this is likely preferable from a
    security standpoint to binding to all interfaces, and sidesteps the question of
    cross-platform compatibility (some platforms may have IPV6_V6ONLY enabled by
    default).

    Add extension points to the gRPC Session and Server code.
